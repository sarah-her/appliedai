    "# Assignment 9 – The Blackjack Learner: Understanding Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "### Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning and Monte Carlo Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics Covered:** Reinforcement Learning Foundations, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Monte Carlo Prediction and Policy Evaluation  \n",
    "**Environment:** A simulated Blackjack game designed to model agent–environment interaction and sequential decision-making under uncertainty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a computational framework in which an agent learns to make decisions through interaction with an environment.  \n",
    "At each time step \\( t \\), the agent observes a state \\( S_t \\), chooses an action \\( A_t \\), receives a reward \\( R_{t+1} \\), and transitions to a new state \\( S_{t+1} \\).  \n",
    "The goal is to learn a policy \\( \\pi(a|s) \\) that maximizes the expected return\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "G_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( \\gamma \\) is the discount factor controlling the importance of future rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov Decision Process (MDP):\n",
    "An MDP defines this interaction through the tuple \\( (S, A, P, R, \\gamma) \\), representing states, actions, transition probabilities, rewards, and the discount factor.  \n",
    "The Markov property assumes that the next state depends only on the current state and action, enabling tractable modeling of sequential decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Prediction:\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods estimate value functions by averaging returns from complete episodes of experience.  \n",
    "For a state \\( s \\), the value estimate \\( V(s) \\) is updated as  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "V(s) \\leftarrow V(s) + \\alpha [G_t - V(s)]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( G_t \\) is the total reward (return) observed after visiting state \\( s \\).  \n",
    "These methods do not require a model of the environment and converge with sufficient sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Context:\n",
    "In this assignment, a simplified Blackjack environment is used to demonstrate how an agent learns optimal play through experience. By repeatedly playing simulated games, the agent estimates the expected reward of different game states using Monte Carlo averaging. You will visualize learned value patterns, interpret how decisions improve through experience, and discuss the properties of RL algorithms.\n"
